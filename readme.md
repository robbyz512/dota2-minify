## :information_desk_person: Is this safe to use?

This open-source project has been around for over 3 years with thousands of downloads and users. While binaries are offered for ease of use, anyone can compile it themselves.

And no one has ever been banned for mods. This project strictly deals with mods and never hacking related things like memory/file manipulation. It is utilizing Valve's approved methods (VPK loading) for creating assets, as documented on the [official Valve Wiki.](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VPK) Historically Valve has only disabled assets from loading and never punished modders. The worst thing that can happen is a mod stops working and that's it.
